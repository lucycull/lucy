Some of you may already know, I’m a skateboarder (though haven’t been able to recently due to breaking my scaphoid) what started as a simple interest, mostly from playing Tony Hawks Pro Skater and Skate as a teenager, that I decided to dip my toes into in real life, ended up with me falling in love and spending countless hours at the gym and improving my diet in order to improve my skating.

## The Facts

Beetroot carries a high amount of nitrate which when your body is running lower on oxygen for example when skating these nitrates come into play and dilate your blood vessels providing your body with more oxygen flow.

## Best methods for ingestion

There are a few ways you may want to ingest this purple vegetable, you could just start chewing on them as they are, you could cook them into various dishes if you want to mask the taste or my personal favourite, blend them up into a juice using, a whole beetroot and some water and then you drink around 30–50ml in the morning and the evening and you’re good to go. I chose this method due to knowing exactly how much to eat.

## Effects

Well I must say that my blood flow at high heart rate has improved, during skating, while cycling to work. Is this a direct result of the beetroot? Or is it just the fact that I am eating healthily and working out regularly? I am unsure, perhaps in the near future I will stop eating it for a while and then start again and see if I notice any differences. Either way I am pretty sure that it can’t hurt

## Other sources of nitrate

You can also get nitrate from other vegetables that contain high amounts of the wonderful stuff, including: Spinach, Kale, Lettuce, Celery and Cress.
