Hi my name is Lucy, I’m currently a student studying Music Promotion at Solent University.


I have been doing art and design for about six years and photography for four years. In this time I have curated my own exhibition space, photographed a number of bands at venues across Southampton, produced the photo content for an infant school prospectus and started up a potential web design and development company.


In my spare time, I enjoy reading, creating art, taking photos and travelling. I’ve been lucky enough to visit cities such as London, New York, Amsterdam, Rome, Belfast and I hope to visit many more in the future. I enjoy exploring lesser-known places throughout these destinations as well as the obvious tourist attractions and cultural sites. 


The most recent books I have enjoyed the most include The Illustrated Man which I plan to feature a review about on my blog, The Complete Robot, American Psycho and The Light Between Oceans. 


Most recently I have discovered an interest in web design, logo creation and digital art which is where the inspiration to create my own website came from. I had a lot of fun designing how my site would look and though I re-designed several times I could see myself improving with each one. I now feel confident in creating diverse web designs for a variety of different purposes as well as branding and logo designs. 


One of my biggest hobbies is photography though, it feels natural to have a camera in my hand. I was lucky enough to be able to combine my love of music with my passion for photography and work as a freelance in-house photographer at the local grassroots venue The Joiners in Southampton, as well as other venues in the area. As well as gig photography I have also taken photos at an Infant School in Eastleigh for a prospectus which you can view here: [https://primarysite-prod-sorted.s3.amazonaws.com/hiltingbury-infant/UploadedDocument/007f1694f1db431e8a7eb00a6d0dfc5e/hiltingbury-infant-school-prospectus-2020.pdf](https://primarysite-prod-sorted.s3.amazonaws.com/hiltingbury-infant/UploadedDocument/007f1694f1db431e8a7eb00a6d0dfc5e/hiltingbury-infant-school-prospectus-2020.pdf). 


During the Coronavirus lockdown in 2020, my boyfriend and I started making websites together (I can design and he can code) as a way of practising and solidifying our skills. This soon turned into the potential for a business, and we started to create these sites more seriously. Working on our own brand, logo and website we created our design and development company Adapt Studio, which you can find on various socials and our website. We have also decided to expand our studio into all media creation such as podcasts and YouTube videos, including a music podcast called The Track.


Since moving out for university I have found enjoyment in cooking and baking too, after starting to eat on a vegan diet I have loved finding new and tasty recipes, both sweet and savoury, to try out! I am health conscious so I try to eat healthy (with a few naughty days here and there) which makes cooking even more fun. As well as healthy eating I like to exercise, particularly swimming and I do yoga regularly as it helps to organise my thoughts, push my body and keep me feeling healthy. I started working out properly during my first year of university and I’ve found its improved other areas of my life such as sleeping, energy levels, concentration and motivation.


I will be writing further blog posts on everything I’ve touched on in this post but this is just a quick introduction to me. If there’s anything else you’d like to know feel free to send me a message through my contact page or my socials (which can be found on the home screen).
