Throughout lockdown, my boyfriend and I have been watching various Netflix TV shows and without realizing the majority of them turned out to be Netflix Originals. If you’re looking for inspiration for things to watch and you’re not sure where to start, I’d recommend any of these.

## 10. You

I watched the first season of ‘You’ when it came out and got pretty hooked on it. It’s pretty dark and unexpected at times but worth checking out if you’re into that. I’ve not got around to watching season 2 yet and I believe season 3 has been confirmed as well so if they’re as good as the first season it could be a binge-worthy show.

## 9. Sex Education

Sex Education is a quirky show about growing up, the main narrative involves Otis whose mum is a sex therapist. He starts giving out much-needed sex advice to his clueless peers at school and it escalates from there. Alongside this there is an array of different characters each with their own complex stories, there’s lots to laugh about but also a lot of serious issues being addressed.

## 8. Riverdale

Now four seasons in Riverdale is one of the rare TV shows that I still come back to, I find that by the third season shows tend to get a little tedious or boring, but Riverdale still has it. There’s teen drama, love stories, mystery, murder, and crime, and I’m still enjoying it as much as the first season. It’s not where I thought the series was going when I first started watching and there’s been a lot of weird, off the wall narratives along the way which is one of the reasons I’m still so hooked.

## 7. Final Space

Having finished the animated TV show Disenchantment, my boyfriend and I were craving another short-animated show to watch in the evening or when we have a spare 20 minutes. Having an interest in science fiction and space this title caught our attention and though I wasn’t immediately as hooked as my boyfriend was, I have to admit it’s a catchy show. We both found ourselves quoting the show and doing impressions of the characters pretty much straight after the first episode. If you’re looking for something fun and silly, I would give it a go.

## 6. Black Mirror

I don’t think this one needs too much explanation… Black Mirror is incredibly clever, it portrays the near future and technological advances in such a realistic way it’s haunting, showing both positive and negative possibilities. Some of the episodes are quite dark and I took a break from the show after an early episode that was particularly affecting but it is a clever show and well worth watching.

## 5. The Witcher

I enjoyed this more than my boyfriend did I think but I wasn’t as interested in playing the game as much as Mac was, nor had I seen any of the game to be able to compare any aspects of it like how they portray Gerald in the show compared to the game. I enjoy medieval fantasy shows and films so the combination of action, love interests, magic, and comedy made this a series I enjoyed, plus how the story is told was particularly interesting. It took me a few episodes to piece together the linear narrative and the various character’s place in it but once I had figured that out, I loved it, plus there’s a ridiculously catchy song in it that I can annoy my boyfriend with by singing it.

## 4. Disenchantment

As previously mentioned, Mac and I watched Disenchantment not too long ago and we were both pleasantly surprised with it. We noticed it was from the same creator as The Simpsons and Futurama so had an idea of what it was going to be like. Although it had a slow start and we weren’t immediately sure about it we found that we wanted to keep watching ‘one more episode’ and that we were enjoying it more than we thought. The dynamic of the show is interesting and the more you think about the universe of Matt Groening in terms of where it fits amongst his other shows the more intriguing it gets.

## 3. Love Death Robots

Having popped up a few times on Netflix I decided to add this show to my watch list out of curiosity. Not knowing what to expect we were both pleasantly surprised by the creativity and storylines presented in this series. Each episode is a standalone story with a different duration, character set, and even art style, although there is generally an underlying theme of sci-fi somewhere in them. I particularly enjoyed “Three Robots”, “Fish Night” and “Zima Blue” but there is an episode for everyone, some of them of comical, some of them are dark, some make you think but they’re all really good.

## 2. Big Mouth

This is a super easy, binge-worthy show to watch with short episodes and fun characters that have been developed well. Plus, what’s not to laugh about when it comes to puberty and hormone monsters! It follows two best friends, Nick and Andrew, and their experiences of growing up, as well as the friends around them, you also get to know the families of the characters too not just their school life. It will make you laugh due to its awkward relatability.

## 1. Stranger Things

This is another show I feel like I don’t have to explain too much and if you haven’t seen it yet, you should give it a watch. With a soft spot for the 80s, the soundtrack and dress of the series are enough for me to fall in love with it, so mixed with the supernatural sci-fi theme this is easily the number one spot for me.
